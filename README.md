# Advent of Code 2022

For every solution there is an example file and an input file.

## data

All the examples are located on the `data` folder. They are formatted as:

```
dayXX_example.txt
```

Put your input as: 

```
dayXX_example.txt
```

Where: 
 * `XX` is the day with leading zeros if minor than 10

## Running the exercises

Each day has its own class, but they have all the same signature. Eg:

```python
calories = Calories(True)
```

To run the examples (in order to test it). Or:

```python
calories = Calories(False)
```

To run the real thing.
